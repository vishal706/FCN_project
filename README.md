# FCN_project

In this project, we have implemented reliability features of the TCP on the application layer over UDP. In recent times, there have been renewed interests among enterprises in using UDP as their transport layer protocol. After the relatively less success of SPDY, Google came up with an out-of-the-box solution of QUIC in 2014. Google has claimed performance improvements like a reduction in YouTube video rebuffer by 15-18% and Google search latency by 3.6-8% using QUIC. We have taken inspiration from the design of QUIC and implemented our own Reliable-UDP protocol.
